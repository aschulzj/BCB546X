# UNIX Assignment## Project Background### Data Inspection* Become familiar with the files and to describe their structure and their dimensions (file size,number of columns, number of lines, etc...)*  The files are: fang_et_al_genotypes.txt: a published SNP data set including maize, teosinte (i.e., wild maize),and Tripsacum (a close outgroup to the genus Zea) individuals2. snp_position.txt: an additional data file that includes the SNP id (first column), chromosomelocation (third column), nucleotide location (fourth column) and other information for the SNPs genotypedin the fang_et_al_genotypes.txt file### Data ProcessingFor maize (Group = ZMMIL, ZMMLR, and ZMMMR in the third column of thefang_et_al_genotypes.txt file) we want 20 files in total:* 10 files (1 for each chromosome) with SNPs ordered based on increasing position values and with missingdata encoded by this symbol: ?* 10 files (1 for each chromosome) with SNPs ordered based on decreasing position values and withmissing data encoded by this symbol: -* 1 file with all SNPs with unknown positions in the genome (these need not be ordered in any particularway)* 1 file with all SNPs with multiple positions in the genome (these need not be ordered in any particular way)For teosinte (Group = ZMPBA, ZMPIL, and ZMPJA in the third column of the fang_et_al_genotypes.txt file) we want 20 files in total:* 10 files (1 for each chromosome) with SNPs ordered based on increasing position values and with missingdata encoded by this symbol: ?* 10 files (1 for each chromosome) with SNPs ordered based on decreasing position values and withmissing data encoded by this symbol: -* 1 file with all SNPs with unknown positions in the genome (these need not be ordered in any particularway)* 1 file with all SNPs with multiple positions in the genome (these need not be ordered in any particular way)##Project Script and Data### Data Inspection### fang et al genotypes##  	$ wc fang_et_al_genotypes.txtNumber of Lines: 2783Number of Words: 2744038Number of Characters: 11051939 ##	$ awk '{print NF}' fang_et_al_genotypes.txt | sort -nu | tail -n 1Number of Columns: 986##	$ du -hs fang_et_al_genotypes.txtTotal File Size: 11M### snp position##	$ wc snp_position.txt### Data Processinggrep out the population IDs, some maize, some teosinte, create a maize file by grepping out the populationExtended regular expressions where you grep multiple different search patternsGrep populations for maize and teosinte, send one to maize file and one to teosinte fileStart here!## 	$ grep -E "(ZMMIL|ZMMLR|ZMMMR)" fang_et_al_genotypes.txt > maize_genotypes.txtMoved Maize genotypes to separate file, labeled maize_genotypes.txt##	$ wc -l maize_genotypes.txt1573 lines##	$ awk '{print NF}' maize_genotypes.txt | sort -nu | tail -n 1986 columns##	$ grep -E "(ZMPBA|ZMPIL|ZMPJA)" fang_et_al_genotypes.txt > teosinte_genotypes.txtMoved Teosinte genotypes to separate file, labeled teosinte_genotypes.txt##	$ wc -l teosinte_genotypes.txt975 lines##	$ awk '{print NF}' teosinte_genotypes.txt | sort -nu | tail -n 1986 columns
